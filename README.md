## **Data Science For EveryOne Mentorship and BootCamp Program** 

### Week 1:
* Question 1). Imagine you're working with Sprint, one of the biggest telecom companies in the USA. They're really keen on figuring out how many customers might decide to leave them in the coming months. Luckily, they've got a bunch of past data about when customers have left before, as well as info about who these customers are, what they've bought, and other things like that.

So, if you were in charge of predicting customer churn how would you go about using machine learning to make a good guess about which customers might leave?

### Week 4:
* Question 1). Using the [Craiglist Vehicles Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mbaabuharun/craigslist-vehicles), create a Time-Series model using the approach outlined below:
  * Start by addressing missing values in the dataset. You can handle this by filling in missing values with the median for numerical columns and the mode for categorical columns.
  * Ensure that the data types of the columns are appropriate. Specifically, make sure to convert the 'posting_date' column to a datetime data type.
  Utilize the 'posting_date' column to create a datetime index for the dataset. This will facilitate the analysis of temporal patterns.
  * With clean data, explore it using various visualizations and statistical analysis techniques. This step is crucial for understanding temporal patterns, identifying seasonal trends, and analyzing demand-supply dynamics by region and vehicle type.
  * Build the time-series chart.
