## **Data Science For EveryOne Mentorship and BootCamp Program** 

### Week 1:
* Question 1). Imagine you're working with Sprint, one of the biggest telecom companies in the USA. They're really keen on figuring out how many customers might decide to leave them in the coming months. Luckily, they've got a bunch of past data about when customers have left before, as well as info about who these customers are, what they've bought, and other things like that.

So, if you were in charge of predicting customer churn how would you go about using machine learning to make a good guess about which customers might leave?
